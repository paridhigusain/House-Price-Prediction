# House-Price-Prediction
Build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Performed feature engineering along with visualization of the dataset present to understand the data and make it feasible as an input for a ML model. implemented StandardScaler() and other encoding techniques present in sklearn library in order to perform feature engineering. Followed by using of ML algorithm - RandomForestRegressor, an ensemble learning technique to perform price predictions on prepared data.
